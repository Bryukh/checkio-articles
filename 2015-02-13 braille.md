# Braille Translator Overview

Hi, CiO friends.

Today I would like to remind you about [Braille system][wikipedia_link].
Braille is a tactile writing system used by the blind and the visually impaired.
It is traditionally written with embossed paper.

And in ["English to Braille Translator"][mission_link] Checkio mission you need to write a convertor
from a text to Braille representation. For this we will use the 6-dots Braille alphabet.

    width="300px", style="display: block; margin-left: auto;margin-right: auto;">
    
So your script which you will write for this mission would be useful when parsing braille text and formatting it for printing,
or it could be used to translate existing text into braille for others. Let's look how CiO players did that.

First we can not skip [veky][veky_profile] a [Visual][veky_visual] solution. 
Try to comprehend this code without assistance before you will look at comments, where the author explains it.
Just as a hint -- "The secret is R. :-)".

```
R = " a,b*k*l*cif*msp*e-h*o!r*djg*ntq$***_u?v*****x****.**z******#yw*"
```

Honestly, it's look like magic, but when you get it - you like this.

If previous solution was too magic-ish for you, then look at [vinc][vinc_profile] [solution][vinc_translator].
Vinc uses some predefined data and then weave results with it.
This solution can be simpler for python newbies.

And if you like function decomposition, camelCase and formatted comments, 
then [jcg][jcg_profile] solution that is titled as ["First"][jcg_first] will be for you.

You can learn how to write code as a science article in [Blastus][Blastus_profile] ["First" solution][Blastus_first].
All fragments are placed on shelves and inside many, many for loops.

I think it will be enough for weekend reading. Don't forget upvote interesting solutions -- authors will be pleased.
Feel free ask questions in comments if something is not clear in a solution or ask advisers if you have problems
with some mission -- CheckiO community is friendly and gladly will help you.
