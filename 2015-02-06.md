Pangram Review
----------------

Hello, CiO People!

Today I would examine the fresh CheckiO mission ["Pangram"](http://www.checkio.org/mission/pangram/share/6d2c66db9c7d72144d48c01ae323e868/).
This mission was based on an idea by [Sim0000](http://www.checkio.org/user/Sim0000/),
which had added to a recent forum [post](http://www.checkio.org/forum/post/2977/mission-ideas/#comment-23718).
You can propose you own ideas there too and we will try to make them happen.

[Pangram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pangram) is a sentence which uses every letter of the alphabet at least once.
In this mission you need check text and verify if it is a pangram for the English alphabet or not.

There are many methods which can be employed to solve this problem. 
As we can see, it easily to write a solution with a time complexity of O(N), 
you just use hash table data types to solve the problem. 
However, we will not stop at this and will looking for more interesting solutions which were made by CheckiO players.

## Clear

The first solution we'll look at is titled ["First"](http://www.checkio.org/mission/pangram/publications/dagger126/python-3/first/share/2a462ede1eda10f6c3077357ec642a92/)
and was created by [dagger126](http://www.checkio.org/user/dagger126/) with a simple and obvious solution. 
Good usage of built-in set data type.
 
```
from string import ascii_lowercase​
​
def check_pangram(text):
    return set(ascii_lowercase).issubset(set(text.lower()))
```

Here's an alternate method by [DmitriyS](http://www.checkio.org/user/DmitriyS/) titled 
["all() + string.ascii_lowercase"](http://www.checkio.org/mission/pangram/publications/DmitriyS/python-27/first/share/23bc0848d1244cf8fc056d46cf3a7a84/)
As we can see from a title this is a usage of the "all" function with comprehension. 
Iterate all letters from the alphabet and check they are in the given text.

```
def check_pangram(text):
    text = text.lower()
    return all(c in text for c in string.ascii_lowercase)
```

We have another ["First"](http://www.checkio.org/mission/pangram/publications/saklar13/python-3/first/share/79f383a0c08e1dac30dcf1ab8463d852/)
by [saklar13](http://www.checkio.org/user/saklar13/) this time. 
This solution presents a nice way to solve our problem without using the alphabet, 
but with rather the *str.isalpha* method.

```
check_pangram = lambda text: len({x for x in text.lower() if x.isalpha()}) == 26
```

## Creative

In the top of the creative category, we have the ["65" solution](http://www.checkio.org/mission/pangram/publications/DiZ/python-3/65/share/fab58c78c42b3e1d93e6e3b58a1dc1f4/)
by [DiZ](http://www.checkio.org/user/DiZ/). Looks like a code golf solution with double meaning using "65"! ;-)

```
check_pangram=lambda t:set(map(chr,range(65,91)))<=set(t.upper())
```

["Not Very Clean but works"](http://www.checkio.org/mission/pangram/publications/schanjr/python-27/not-very-clean-but-works/share/de57ea9d78879a7358b8dc5ef516402a/)
by [schanjr](http://www.checkio.org/user/schanjr/) is "the most complicated solution of the task" as community member
[veky](http://www.checkio.org/user/veky/) put it. 
But this solution has made it in the "Creative" category, 
so I'm sure schanjr made something special. 
The solution has 20 strings, but this line should be especially noted:

```
...
if all(x is x>=2 for x in count.itervalues()):
...
```

about usage if-else for return can be useful for newbies. Veky explains best practice.

But if we would make award for "the most complicated solution of the task", then I would add 
["First | Naive"](http://www.checkio.org/mission/pangram/publications/bundgaard/python-3/first-naive/share/6b77e9e39c53e380163d0d101e1d1d47/)

## And

We often meet solutions which are written with Python but are not "in" Python - 
they use a LISP or Java style for example. 
When I first started to learn Python I wrote C-code with python syntax and it was funny for python gurus to read.

So how about trying to write a "Pangram" solution with Python, but not in Python? Could you do it?
